# LM_Based_CM_Extraction
Levenbergâ€“Marquardt (LM) method for coupling matrix extraction of microwave filters.
This is a gradient-based coupled matrix extraction optimization algorithm that is slower than MVF, but it does not require matrix rotation.
-----------------------------------------
This example is a fifth-order Chebyshev coaxial filter. If you want to use the code for other filters, change the optimization variables and corresponding gradients.
